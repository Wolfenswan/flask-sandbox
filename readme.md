A very simple flask-based site to provide easy access to my python-based applets.

Currently contains:
- Audax ABC-Trainer: Generates workouts from user-input(strings) or randomized selection, providing an exercise for each letter. Images were provided by my gym during the corona lockdowns.
- Orderform Generator for Staatsarchiv Hamburg: Automatically generates order pdfs for Hamburg's state archive, streamlining the usually cumbersome ordering process.
