A very simple flask-based site to provide easy access to my python-based applets. Might eventually grow into a proper homepage.

Currently contains:
- Audax ABC-Trainer: Generates workouts from words, based on images provided by my gym during corona lockdown.
An [updated Standalone version](https://github.com/Wolfenswan/audax-abc-standalone) exists as well.
- Orderform Generator for Staatsarchiv Hamburg: Automatically generates order pdfs for Hamburg's state archive, making the usually cumbersome process a lot easier
